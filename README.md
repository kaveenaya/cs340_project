Moonlight Melodies 

Project collaborators- Preet Patel, Ankith Sridhar, Kaveenaya Omkumar 

Moonlight Melodies is a music shop in Portland. Where we were facing challenges to manage our huge collections of tunes. With over $100,00 in sales happening each year keeping track of everything was becoming a hassle. So, we decided to make a database website that will help us keep track of all our songs, instruments, artists, employees, customers, shopping carts, and sales on one page where everything will be easily accessible and organized.
